🛠️ Technologies Used:

Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas & NumPy ,Natural Language Processing (NLP) ,TF-IDF Vectorizer, Logistic Regression, Joblib, Streamlit

The Email Spam Classification System is a machine learning–based Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that automatically classifies email messages as Spam or Not Spam (Ham).

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, including:

Text preprocessing and cleaning

Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization

Model training using Logistic Regression

Model saving with Joblib

Deployment through a Streamlit web application for real-time prediction
