📧 Email Spam Classification System
🔹 Project Overview

The Email Spam Classification System is a machine learning–based Natural Language Processing (NLP) project designed to automatically classify emails as Spam or Not Spam (Ham).

This project demonstrates the complete ML workflow including:

Text preprocessing

Feature extraction using TF‑IDF

Model training with Random Forest Classifier

Model saving using Joblib

Deployment through a Streamlit web application for real‑time prediction

🚀 Features

Binary classification of email messages (Spam vs. Ham)

Clean text preprocessing pipeline

TF‑IDF vectorization for numerical feature conversion

High‑accuracy Random Forest model

Real‑time prediction via user‑friendly Streamlit UI

🛠️ Technologies Used
